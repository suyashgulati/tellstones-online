# TellStones
This repo is based on the newly released game called "TellStones" released by Riot Games.

This game is normally played as a board game, but I wanted to transition it into a computer game as a learning experience.

More info about the game can be found here: https://tellstones.com/en-us/

The manual can be found here: https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt0d5213e3ccf9f400/bltd5de22e9cd4788c5/5f624e7af0d2b04fae76b15e/tellstones-en.pdf
